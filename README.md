-----------
* What does this package do?

	* disk.frame performs a similar role to distributed systems such as Apache Spark, Python’s Dask, and Julia’s JuliaDB.jl for medium data which are datasets that are too large for RAM but not quite large enough to qualify as big data.

* You should use this package, if
	* You are dealing with medium size data(100s of gigabyte) ![Examples](images/data_sizes.png)
	* would like to leverage from ssd level performance & paralelization to fasten your data analysis
